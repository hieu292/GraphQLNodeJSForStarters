# GraphQL NodeJS For Starters

## Introduction

This is my project I create based on [https://github.com/leebenson/graphql-with-sequelize](https://github.com/leebenson/graphql-with-sequelize)
I fixed some errors and add some example (Query_1.txt - Query_5.txt). You can try it.

## How to use:

First of all, you need to install sql RMDB (such as: Mysql, MariaDB or Postgres). My project use Postgres.

Step 1: run "npm install".
Step 2: change config.js file.
Step 3: run "npm start".
Step 4: go to [localhost:3000/graphql](localhost:3000/graphql) browser. and try all 5 examples.

I hope you enjoy it. Fun to learn!
